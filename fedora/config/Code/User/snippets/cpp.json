	// Place your snippets for cpp here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "log",
		"body": [
			"cout << $1;",
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	},
	"Initial setup": {
		"prefix": "init",
		"body": [
			"#include <iostream>",
			"#include <string>",
			"",
			"using namespace std;",
			"",
			"int main(${1:int argc, char *argv[]}) {",
			"\t$0",
			"\treturn 0;",
			"}"
		],
		"description": "Initial setup"
	}
